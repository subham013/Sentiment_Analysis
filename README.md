Utilized Libraries: To achieve this objective, our code leverages several Python libraries, each with a specific role in the analysis process:

1.seaborn and matplotlib: These visualization libraries are employed for creating insightful plots and graphs. They help us visualize the sentiment distribution, patterns, and relationships within the dataset![image](https://github.com/shaikharshan/Sentiment-Analysis-Project-ROBERTA-VADER-/assets/111241828/514f9140-c4a5-4dfa-86db-ec99d518817a)
2.nltk (Natural Language Toolkit): nltk is a natural language processing library. In this code, it is used for various text preprocessing tasks, such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.
3.Transformers (Hugging Face Transformers): The transformers library from Hugging Face is crucial for integrating pre- trained neural network models, like RoBERTa, into our sentiment analysis pipeline.
